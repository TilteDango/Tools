# Description

This tool serves the purpose of circumventing restrictions imposed by systems that detect consecutive unsuccessful login attempts. By employing a combination of brute-force testing with a valid username and password, it aims to navigate through security measures that limit repeated login failures. The tool generates a set of login attempts, utilizing a correct username and password along with potential alternatives, enabling users to assess and potentially bypass login restrictions on targeted systems.

## Usage

```bash
BruteForcer.py -u VALID_USERNAME -p VALID_PASSWORD -U USERFILE -P PASSFILE
```
